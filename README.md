  ``Moonish`` directory

- Add your desired window titles (case-sensitive) to immersive darkmode to ``whitelisted_windows.txt``.
Every line is part of window title that should have our dark immersive titlebar. Example:
``Minecraft`` will enable dark mode for windows with titles: ``Minecraft Launcher``, ``Launcher Minecraft 1.20`` etc.
